A little spin on the classic game: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock:
* Using Javascript to build the game
* Comparing results with else if statements
* Using emoji's to visually represent the choices
* Using function to generate random cpu choices
* Getting the user input by ID and using this for comparison
* Displaying the winner of each round on screen
* Adding a counter for the number of wins
* Game is responsive with use of Bootstrap
* Adding CSS to give a little retro feel to the game
